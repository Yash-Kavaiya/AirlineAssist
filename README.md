## Sample Agent Interactions

### Scenario 1: Complex Rebooking
```python
# Orchestrator Agent coordinates multiple agents
async def handle_rebooking_request(customer_query):
    # Parse intent and extract key information
    flight_info = await flight_ops_agent.get_flight_status(flight_number)
    
    if flight_info.status == "CANCELLED":
        # Get alternative options
        alternatives = await booking_agent.find_alternatives(
            origin=flight_info.origin,
            destination=flight_info.destination,
            date=flight_info.date,
            passenger_count=customer.party_size
        )
        
        # Check policies for rebooking
        policies = await policy_agent.get_rebooking_rules(
            fare_class=customer.booking.fare_class
        )
        
        # Apply loyalty benefits
        benefits = await loyalty_agent.get_member_benefits(
            customer_id=customer.id
        )
        
        # Present coordinated solution
        return await orchestrator.present_rebooking_options(
            alternatives, policies, benefits
        )
```

### Scenario 2: Baggage Claim
```python
async def track_baggage(bag_tag_number):
    # Baggage Agent handles tracking
    status = await baggage_agent.track_bag(bag_tag_number)
    
    if status.location == "DELAYED":
        # Coordinate with operations for delivery
        delivery_info = await flight_ops_agent.get_next_available_flight(
            from_airport=status.current_location,
            to_airport=status.destination
        )
        
        # Check compensation eligibility
        compensation = await policy_agent.check_baggage_compensation(
            delay_hours=status.delay_hours,
            customer_status=customer.loyalty_tier
        )
        
        return await orchestrator.provide_baggage_update(
            tracking_info=status,
            delivery_estimate=delivery_info,
            compensation=compensation
        )
